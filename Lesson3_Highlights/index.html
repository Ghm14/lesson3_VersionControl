                <span class="text-muted">Version Control </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a single main repository for all the project files made and used by team members working together on a project. It allows team members to grab a file, read or edit it, then drop them right back into the repository for others to grab and do the same! This is also maintained thoroughly by the version control system. The system keep on record many different things, like who changed the file, what was changed, what the old file looked like, and it evens allows the ability to merge the two files! Version control is super interesting because it is a really cool way of allowing team members to easily exchange files with one another! It is relevant to the class because much of programming is done through team work, and version control allows a higher level of team work!  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git!</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of version control system that we talked about in the last highlight. Git prides itself on the ability to handle projects of any size with speed and consistency. Git is a top class system, allowing access to each file in the repository quickly and to each and every member. It is all local, so you can be offline while using Git! Git is a free and open source version control system! Git is an easy to use and top of the line version control system! Git interests me because this is the first version control system i've been introduced to, and it seems really handy! It is relevant to the class because this is the version control system we'll be using. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repository </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a storage center for files, that is managed by a version control system, like Git! The repository is responsible for all files, including all edited and revised files, along with their previous versions kept at the repository users discretion. The repository is opened up and navigated by the user, allowing them to choose the file they would like to work on with ease. Think of it as like a library between team members, each with access to edit the books and return them for the next person to do what is needed to be done until the project is completed. The repository holds a massive amount of data in a single place! A repository is interesting to me because it holds such a massive amount of files and data. It is relevant to class because we created one today!  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands! </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has many different commands that allow you to navigate the interface, and search through, or even change things as you see fit. Git config sets configuration values for things like user names, email, file formats and more! Git init initializes a git repository creating the initial .git in an existing or new project. Git add adds changes to your files in your working directory to your index, and git rm removes files from your working directory and index so they won't be tracked. There are many git commands that do a massive assortment of things to the repository, and that is one of the reasons i find git commands so interesting. Git commands are relevant to class because we need to learn them to navigate  the git repository. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Three Main States!</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of if not the most important thing to know about git is the three main states of git. Your files can reside in three main states in git, staged, modified, and committed. Staged means that you have a file that has been modified marked and ready to go in its current version to your next snapshot commit. Modified means that you have edited or made changes to your file, but have not committed those changes to the database yet. Committed means that the data is safe, and successfully stored on your database. There are also three main sections of a git project, the git directory, the working tree, and the staging area. This is interesting to me because it allows me to learn more about git, and relevant to class because we need to know this about git to have a deeper understanding of it.  </p>
